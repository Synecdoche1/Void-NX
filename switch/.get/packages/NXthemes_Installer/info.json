Should issues arise another update will be released to take care of that hopefully not\\n\\nv1.5\\n\\nAnimation support (bflan), now themes can contain animated parts.\\nFull 8.X support, all incompatible built-in layouts were updated\\nMost old nxthemes should still work on 8.0 as the installer will try to automatically fix them, the ones that still don't work unfortunately have to be built from scratch, info on how to fix a layout for 8.0 has been added here\\nHopefully fixed custom fonts on ReiNX\\nFinally fixed the remote install network code\\n\\nv1.4\\n\\nCustom font support ! Copy any TTF in the themes folder to install it.\\nCustom usd1 panes support for nxthemes, these kind of panes allow more customization by changing the shape of icons or add shadows. The layout editor will be updated soon.\\nSupport for the player select applet\\nSupport for nxthemes without a background image, these kind of themes just edit the layout and look good on any color setting (dark or light \"theme\" option in the console settings)\\nOther minor fixes and improvements\\nNote that custom fonts also apply to titles that load the font from the home menu, there's no way to prevent this.\\n\\n\\n\\nv1.3\\n\\nAutomatic home menu extraction, works on any firmware and any cfw, keys are not needed anymore. this means full support for 7.0.x\\nReboot to payload button for atmosphere users.\\nCustom album images are now supported, it's also possible to set a custom color for the icon with a layout (only if using a custom image)\\nCLI support for the injector on Linux.\\n\\nv1.2\\n\\nSupport for custom layouts for common.szs (all firmwares)\\nBetter support for firmwares <= 5.X\\nSupport for command line args\\nFixed many ui issues and and minor bugs\\n\\nv1.1\\n\\nMultiselect to install multiple themes at the same time\\nRemote install to install themes without having to copy them first\\nTheme background preview for nxtheme files\\nAuto extraction of the home menu directly on the console.\\nTheme shuffle support with the new Theme Switcher sysmodule, check it out here , as this is in beta please read the warnings before using it.\\nThis should also fix the darker images bug when converting to DDS"
